Hello! My name is Tiffany, and I am currently a Data Scientist at Spotify. After studying Statistics at UCLA, my passion for data science has continued to grow. I am a self-taught programmer, and constantly want to learn and explore new technologies. I love to tactically use data to drive decisions and make an impact.

Some Fun Facts:
- I am a Yelp Elite
- I use to figure skate competitively for 10 years
- I have traveled to over 10 countries (and many more to go!)
